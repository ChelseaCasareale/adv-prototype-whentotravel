# Advanced Prototype for "When to Travel" personal project

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.18.

For stills of the design of this project: [Behance Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/43870993/When-to-Travel)

As a protoype, this project does not have full functionality, mostly due to the lack of database(s).

**There is no:**
- User sign up and login functionality
- Search (the search page has been premade and does not represent a real API call)
- Certain pages do not exist
- Travel price API not connected (*in progress*)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
